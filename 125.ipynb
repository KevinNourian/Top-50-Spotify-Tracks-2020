        "Congrats!\n",
        "You completed almost all assignments and tasks of this Sprint.\n",
        "You did a great job.\n",
        "In this Part, you will need to prove all the skills that you learned.\n",
        "As the final assignment of this Sprint, you will analyze the Top 50 Spotify Tracks 2020 dataset.\n",
        "To complete this task, you will have to apply all that you have learned about Data Analysis, Linear Algebra, NumPy, and Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Context\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine that you are a data analyst working for Spotify.\n",
        "Your team is responsible for content analysis, and in this quarter, you have decided to analyze Spotify's top hits and quantify what makes a hit song.\n",
        "Your team's product manager has many ideas and prepared a list of questions (requirements) that she wants you to get answers to.\n",
        "After reviewing the list of over 20 questions, you are not in a good mood - you'll have to work a couple of days to get all the answers.\n",
        "Luckily, a few days ago, an experienced data scientist working in your team queried the top 50 tracks for her machine learning project and agreed to share the data with you.\n",
        "This is a significant help - your SQL skills are not too sharp yet, and you don't yet know where to find all the relevant tables in your data warehouse.\n",
        "With this dataset, you are confident that you'll be able to answer all your PM's questions and maybe even look into some things that she didn't ask for.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives for this Part\n",
        "\n",
        "- Practice working with data from Kaggle.\n",
        "- Practice performing basic EDA.\n",
        "- Practice reading data, performing queries and filtering data using Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",

        "  - Which features are strongly negatively correlated?\n",
        "  - Which features are not correlated?\n",
        "- How does the danceability score compare between Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Dance/Electronic, and Alternative/Indie genres?\n",
        "- How does the loudness score compare between Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Dance/Electronic, and Alternative/Indie genres?\n",
        "- How does the acousticness score compare between Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Dance/Electronic, and Alternative/Indie genres?\n",
        "- Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results you got, and what these results mean.\n",
